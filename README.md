# SpecflowExample
WIP - Learning Specflow and brushing up on C#
Most logic revolved around ApiTest.feature

TODO:

Need to look into cleaning up null warnings

Haven't implemented any API calls that use authentication, look into how this can be done with one-size-fits-all step definition

Expand on parameters options

Look into Scenario Outline or equivalent data driven scenario for Specflow

Maybe do an example that Deserializes and compares POCO's instead of direct JSON compare

Look up SQL samples and add some logic for that

Add in Selenium scenarios

Look up Json Pathing solution and implement

Shift some utility methods to Class Extensions
