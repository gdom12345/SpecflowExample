# SpecflowExample
WIP - Learning Specflow and brushing up on C#
Most logic revolved around ApiTest.feature

TODO:
Need to look into cleaning up null warnings
Haven't implemented any API calls that use authentication, look into how this can be done with one-size-fits-all step definition
Expand on parameters options
Look into Scenario Outline or equivalent data driven scenario for Specflow
Maybe do an example that Deserializes and compares POCO's instead of direct JSON compare
Look up SQL samples and add some logic for that
Add in Selenium maybe
Look up Json Pathing solution and implement
Shift some utility methods to Class Extensions
